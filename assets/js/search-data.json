            "content": "Learning Tips . We Strongly recommand learning with playing. We provide notebooks for students to get started. If you get trouble with learning, please feel free to reach out to us facebook, email. . Data Type . Data Type of a variable describe the properties that variable hold. In python, there are some built-in data-type, which described below. . Int (1 ,100, 99) | Float (1.0, 3.14, 2.718) | String (&quot;Myanmar&quot;, &quot;Burma&quot;) | Boolean (True, False) | Complex (1+0j) | null (None) | To describe the various properties in the real world, we must use different data type. . eg.If we want to describe a person&#39;s name, we would use String. Int for his age, Float for his height in (cm), and Boolean for his is_graduated, and so on. . The main take away from this course is knowing the difference data type and their usage. . We could create difference variables in following ways: . # Int int1 = 5 int2 = 3 # Float float1 = 1. float2 = 3.14 # String string1 = &quot;Hello&quot; string2 = &#39;World&#39; # Boolean bool1 = True bool2 = False . Operations on Data Type . Arithmetic Operation on Number Data Type . There are many built-in, already implemented, operations we could do in python. Like, for example, for arithmetic operations: . Addition (+) | Subtraction (-) | Multiplication (*) | Division (/) | Arithemetic operations, as the name suggest, can only be used in Int and Float Data Type. . int1 = 5 int2 = 3 # We can add, subtract two elements of &#39;Int&#39; dtype. print(int1 + int2) # Addition print(int1 - int2) # Subtraction print(int1 * int2) # Multiplication print(int1 / int2) # Division print(int1 % int2) # Remainder print(int1**int2) # Power print() float1 = 1. float2 = 3.14 # We can add, subtract two elements of &#39;Float&#39; dtype. print(float1 + float2) print(float1 - float2) print(float1 * float2) print(float1 / float2) print(float1 % float2) print(float1**float2) . . 8 2 15 1.6666666666666667 2 125 4.140000000000001 -2.14 3.14 0.3184713375796178 1.0 1.0 . String Operation . for variable that is of String data type, we could Concatenate Two string, Or we could use f String format for better formating of string. . In f String, we could enter varibles in the string format. . # Simple concatenate two string concatenate_string = string1 + string2 print(concatenate_string) # F string format. f_string = f&quot;Hello World, Welcome to the wanderland&quot; print(f_string) f_string_var = f&quot;{string1} {string2}, This is testing the f String&quot; print(f_string_var) . . HelloWorld Hello World, Welcome to the wanderland Hello World, This is testing the f String . . Note: We could only do operations on the same data type. For example, Int variable and String variable could not be added (will raise an error). . a = 10 b = &#39;hello world&#39; print(a + b) . . TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-4-857b62d6dea8&gt; in &lt;module&gt; 2 a = 10 3 b = &#39;hello world&#39; -&gt; 4 print(a + b) TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: &#39;int&#39; and &#39;str&#39; . TypeError :can only concatenate str to str | int to int . Different data type cannot be added (concatenate) together. . Reference : Python Official Documentation . We always recommand students to go check out the official document if possible. It might be a bit hard at first, but it definetly worth the effort. . Data Structure . Data Structure is a collection of variables. Based on the method of collecting the varibles, the four basic data structure are presented in Python. . List | Tuple | Dictionary | Set | # Simple Creation of each four types of structures list_obj = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4] set_obj = {1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4} tuple_obj = (1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4) dict_obj = {&#39;a&#39;:1, &#39;b&#39;:2, &#39;c&#39;:3, &#39;d&#39;:4, &#39;e&#39;:1, &#39;f&#39;:2} print(type(list_obj), list_obj) print(type(set_obj), set_obj) print(type(tuple_obj), tuple_obj) print(type(dict_obj), dict_obj) . . &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4] &lt;class &#39;set&#39;&gt; {1, 2, 3, 4} &lt;class &#39;tuple&#39;&gt; (1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4) &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; {&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2, &#39;c&#39;: 3, &#39;d&#39;: 4, &#39;e&#39;: 1, &#39;f&#39;: 2} . List . The Most commonly used data structure in Python, List has the following properties : . Element Accessable with ordered | Mutable (variable value can be changed) | list_height = [170, 172, 174, 160, 178] print(&quot;Heights of student in class...&quot;) print(list_height) . . Heights of student in class... [170, 172, 174, 160, 178] . Access with Index . . Note: If we access element that is out of range, it will rasie IndexError as follow . print(&quot;Student A height : &quot;, list_height[0]) print(&quot;Student B height : &quot;, list_height[1]) print(&quot;Student A height : &quot;, list_height[2]) print(&quot;Student B height : &quot;, list_height[3]) print(&quot;Student A height : &quot;, list_height[4]) print(&quot;Student B height : &quot;, list_height[5]) . . Student A height : 170 Student B height : 172 Student A height : 174 Student B height : 160 Student A height : 178 .

IndexError: list index out of range. Because there are only 5 elements in list, list_height[5] request for 6th element, which is out of range. .

List with different Datatype . We could store, not just one datatype, but variables with different data type in a list. . student_A = [&quot;Aung Aung&quot;, &quot;McE&quot;, 3, 6] student_B = [&quot;Soe Pyae&quot;, &quot;Civil&quot;, 3, 6] print(&quot;Student A Info : &quot;, student_A) print(&quot;Student B Info : &quot;, student_B) . . Student A Info : [&#39;Aung_Paing&#39;, &#39;McE&#39;, 3, 6] Student B Info : [&#39;Soe_Pyae&#39;, &#39;Civil&#39;, 3, 6] . # But Be Aware, We do not know which element contain what information.. print(student_A[2] + student_A[3]) print(student_A[0] + student_A[1]) print(student_A[1] + student_A[2]) . . 9 Aung_PaingMcE .

TypeError :can only concatenate str to str | int to int . Different data type cannot be added (concatenate) together. For that, in python, we use Dictionary to store information. . Dictionary . When we walk into a library and want to find a book, we search by the book title, the book author or may be the published year. Python use the same idea to store value for the varible, by creating the key for that value. That is why you often heard dict in python is key-value paired. . # Dictionary student_A_dict = {&quot;Name&quot; : &quot;Aung_Paing&quot;, &quot;Major&quot; : &quot;McE&quot;, &quot;Batch&quot; : 3, &quot;Year&quot; : 6} student_B_dict = {&quot;Name&quot; : &quot;Soe_Pyae&quot;, &quot;Major&quot; : &quot;Civil&quot;, &quot;Batch&quot; : 3, &quot;Year&quot; : 6} print(student_A_dict) print(student_B_dict) . . {&#39;Name&#39;: &#39;Aung_Paing&#39;, &#39;Major&#39;: &#39;McE&#39;, &#39;Batch&#39;: 3, &#39;Year&#39;: 6} {&#39;Name&#39;: &#39;Soe_Pyae&#39;, &#39;Major&#39;: &#39;Civil&#39;, &#39;Batch&#39;: 3, &#39;Year&#39;: 6} . # In Dict, we only need to specify the &#39;Key&#39; to find the &#39;Value&#39;. print(&quot;Name : &quot;, student_A_dict[&quot;Name&quot;]) print(&quot;Major : &quot;, student_A_dict[&quot;Major&quot;]) print(&quot;Batch : &quot;, student_A_dict[&quot;Batch&quot;]) print(&quot;Year : &quot;, student_A_dict[&quot;Year&quot;]) . . Name : Aung_Paing Major : McE Batch : 3 Year : 6 . Tuple . Sometimes, we need immutable data. Like the Coordinate of a location, your lovely Birthday Date, his/her Phone Number or may be even your gene code. These information, we want to access them, but not change them, are created with Tuple. . home_coordinate = (123, 456) birthday = (11, 1, 1998) print(type(birthday)) print(birthday) . . &lt;class &#39;tuple&#39;&gt; (11, 1, 1998) . # Let&#39;s try to access the month I was borned... month = birthday[1] print(month) # Let&#39;s try to change the day I was borned.... birthday[1] = 10 . . 1 . TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-21-37b3c9f0dcce&gt; in &lt;module&gt; 4 5 # Let&#39;s try to change the day I was borned.... -&gt; 6 birthday[1] = 10 TypeError: &#39;tuple&#39; object does not support item assignment . Set . Set as the name suggest, is a set of collection. it does not care about the order of that collection, it does not even care how many elements are in that collection, it only cares about the representative in that collection. . set_obj = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4} print(type(set_obj)) print(set_obj) . . &lt;class &#39;set&#39;&gt; {1, 2, 3, 4} . Reference : Python Official Documentation on Data Structure . Conditional &amp; Loop in Python . In a Program, there always exist logics. Like, if I am Happy in coding, I would like to get job in Coding. . Conditional . In Python, such conditional are conducted by if-else statement. . # Simple if-else case rain = False if not rain: print(&quot;Today weather is fine, I am going out.&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is raining, I cannot go out...&quot;) . . Today weather is fine, I am going out. . Loop . There are two main types of loop in python. . for | while | For iterate for the given range, While check the condition and continue iteration until condition is False. . for range(): . while condition: . Reference : Python Official Document on if-else statement . Functions . Functions are great arsenal in python. You could think of functions as a factory, process(do function) the raw inputs(Arguments) to Desired products(output). There are two types of functions in Python. . Built-in Function Reference : Python Official | User Defined Function Reference : Python Official | . Built-in Functions . Built-in Functions, come along with python, could be very useful when you need them. Following are some examples for such case. . int_obj = -5 print(int_obj) # Find the absolute value abs_int = abs(int_obj) print(abs_int) # Convert Int to String int2str = str(int_obj) print(int2str, type(int2str)) # Check the datatype print(isinstance(int_obj, int)) # Also, we could use built-in Functions to construct data-structures. set_obj = set((1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)) print(set_obj) . . -5 5 -5 &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; True {1, 2, 3} . . User-Defined Functions . We could defind functions as we would like the program to process. Typical function in python consists of following parts. . . When Constructing a function, what you, the developer, need to know are: . Input (Arguments in functions) | Process (What this function do) | Output(What this function output) | In short, IPO for making a function. . # Make a power calculator with function def power(base_num, pow_num): &quot;&quot;&quot; Calculate the power of base_num Args: base_num(Int) -&gt; Base number for calculation pow_num(Int) -&gt; Power number for calculation Return: power_num(Int) -&gt; Power number for calculation &quot;&quot;&quot; return base_num ** pow_num # We could directly print out the value print(power(2, 3)) # Or we could assign that value to a varible and print. output = power(3, 2) print(output) . . 8 9 . Class . Built-in Class | User Defined Inheritance | . | Class in python acts like a template. eg. When we think of a person, he has properties of [Name, Age, Position, Hobby] and so on. These properties can be applied to every one who is a person. . So, we create a template &#39;Class&#39; and then, create objects, one person each for that class. . . Built-in Class . There are already many built-in classes that come with python. . int_obj = int() print(type(int_obj)) bool_obj = bool() print(type(bool_obj)) . &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; &lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt; . . User-Defined Class . We could create a class for our own need. Assign properties and methods to that class . Inheritance . We could create another class, which has all attributes and methods as Student, but it also has other attributes and methods. We call that inheritance .",
